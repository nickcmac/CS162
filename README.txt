1. A list of 5 topics that you find interesting in relation to computers.

    a.
        Large Langauge Models (LLMs) and how they will effect daily life in the near future.
    b.
        Quantum Computing becoming a reality and in particular how that will effect us in video games.
    c.
        Cybersecurity how rapidily it seems like "threats" are catching up and surpassing "defenses".
    d.
        The emerging threats with "AI" voice cloning and "Deep-fakes" how it will effect attacks in the future.
    e.
        Data centers/Cloud computing, How it seems that we are stepping back from "cloud" computing and how personalized LLMs might lead to an explosion of privatized Data centers.

2. A list of 5 topics that you find or think will be challenging in relation to computers.

    a.
        Privacy and Data Protection, is a fight that we the consumer is losing. It will be interesting to how this will resolve. Will this turn to a more dystopian future?
    b.
        Internet of Things (IoT) Security/Privacy with things like Alexa, Smart Home devices, Ring Door bells and how for instance Ring Door bells have been hacked
             or quote "Amazon says its Sidewalk mesh network of Echo smart speakers and Ring doorbells can now cover nine out of 10 Americans, and is ready for broader integration with third-party device makers."
    c.
       The social implications for not only the workplace but also education when it comes to things like LLMs making certain jobs, tasks, homework useless. 
    d.
        Energy Efficiency and Sustainability, in regards to both hardware and software is quite a struggle. As hardware explodes in performance, software has been able to be less effient and thus the vicious cycle has started.
    e.
        Natural Language Processing (NLP) is still something that isn't quite there yet and has been a weird hurdle.
